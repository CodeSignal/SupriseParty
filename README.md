## SurprisePartyPlanner - Bob’s Branch ("bobs_part")

Welcome to Bob's branch in the **SurprisePartyPlanner** repository! This branch contains Bob’s work on planning the menu and creating a music playlist for the party.

### Bob's Tasks

1. **Plan Menu**  
   Bob is in charge of designing the menu for the party. His menu includes appetizers, main dishes, and sides.


2. **Create Music Playlist**  
   Bob also curates a music playlist for the event. The playlist includes a mix of classic hits and popular party anthems to keep the energy high throughout the celebration.


3. **Update Menu for Vegetarians** 

   Bob realized he forgot to include vegetarian options, so he updated the menu to offer a wide range of selections for vegetarians as well.


4. **Merge Menu and Playlist**  
   After completing both tasks, Bob merges this branch into the `main` branch, integrating his work with Alice’s.

### How to View Bob's Work

- **Menu**: Check the `menu.txt` file for the full party menu, including appetizers, and main courses.
- **Music Playlist**: The `playlist.txt` file contains a curated selection of songs to keep the party lively.

Bob’s branch highlights how specific responsibilities can be worked on independently and then merged into the main project.
