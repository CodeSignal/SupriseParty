## SurprisePartyPlanner - Alice’s Branch ("alice_part")

Welcome to Alice's branch in the **SurprisePartyPlanner** repository! This branch focuses on Alice’s tasks in preparing for the surprise party. Here, Alice is responsible for creating the guest list and planning the decorations.

### Alice's Tasks

1. **Create Guest List**  
   Alice prepares a detailed list of guests, including RSVP status, dietary preferences, and plus-one information.

2. **Plan Decorations**  
   Alice is also responsible for designing and planning the party decorations. This includes the theme, color scheme, table setup, entrance decor, and more to create an enchanting party atmosphere.

3. **Combine Guest List and Decorations**  
   Once both tasks are complete, Alice merges this branch into the `main` branch, where her contributions are integrated with Bob's.

### How to View Alice's Work

- **Guest List**: Check the file `guest_list.txt` to see the complete list of invitees and their details.
